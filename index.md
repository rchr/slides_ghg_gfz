#
## Agenda

* Thursday: General introduction into tools and workflows

* Friday: Practical hands-on session

#
## CityGML Recap 

* Application independent geospatial information model

* International OGC standard

* Different thematic areas (buildings, water, vegetation, bridges etc.)

* CityGML represents

	* 3D geometrey, 3D topology, semantics, and appearance
	* in 5 discrete scales (levels of detail, LOD)

* **Data model (UML)** and **exchange format** (based on GML3)

#
## CityGML Thematic Modelling

![Source: Kolbe, 2012](./pictures/citygml_thematic_modelling.png)

#
## Example: Building Model

* Coherent aggregation of spatial and semantical components

    * (Recursive) composition of building parts
    
    * Thematic surfaces (roof, wall, etc. surfaces) [from LOD2]
    
    * Building installations (stairs, balconies) [from LOD2]
    
    * Openings (doors, windows) [from LOD3]
    
    * Rooms and furniture [from LOD4]

#
## However!

CityGML datasets may become very large 

--&gt; Use database to work with!

#
## Need for Database? Some Examples!

* Multiple simultaneous changes to data (concurrency)

* Data changes on a regular basis

* Large data sets where you only need some observations/ variables

* Share huge data set among many people (data consistency in a working group!)

* Rapid queries

* Web interfaces to data, especially dynamic data

#
## Databases

* Data bases are collections of tables (2D with columns and rows)

* Very good for combining information from several tables

* E.g., select all buildings located in Berlin
 
ID   Name 	    Population
---- ----------	--------------
1    Berlin 	       3502000
2    Potsdam	        159456

Table: Table *City*

ID 	    City 	    Height	
----	--------	----------
1	       1	      10.0
2	       1	      22.2
3	       2 	      15.0

Table: Table *Building*

# 
## Used Tools 

* 3D City Database (3DCityDB)

* 3D City Database Importer/Exporter

* pgAdmin

* QGIS

# 
## 3DCityDB - Overview

![Source: [Kunde, 2014](http://slides.com/fxku/3d-city-database#/)](./pictures/3DCityDB_System.png)

#
## 3DCityDB - Details

Free 3D geo database

Enables to store, represent, and manage virtual 3D city models

Realized as relational database schema for:

- **PostgreSQL/PostGIS**
- Oracle Spatial

#
## Don't be afraid!

* May appear complex in the beginning (60 tables)
	
* But!
	
	* Tables are strucuted logically

	* You probably do not use all tables

--&gt; 3DCityDB not as complex as it seems!


#

#
## PostGIS

* Spatial extension for PostgreSQL

* Support for spatial objects (geometry, geography, raster)

* Spatial predicates (interaction of geometries)

* Spatial operators
	* Measurements (area, distance, length, etc.)
	* Set operations (union, difference, etc.)

* Multi-dimensional spatial indexing

#
## PostGIS - Example

* Select cities with certain area and population
```sql
SELECT name, pop FROM cities 
WHERE pop < 300000  
AND ST_Area(cities.the_geom) < 400000000;
```

* Select houses located in the suburbs
```sql
SELECT houses.*
FROM houses, suburbs
WHERE ST_Intersects(houses.geom, suburbs.geom);
```

## Additional Data Type for Geometry

* The geometry is stored in a extra column, usually termed *geom* or *the_geom*, all based
the following [link](http://postgis.net/docs/manual-2.1/using_postgis_dbmanagement.html)
 
* Uses Well-Known Binary (WKB) and Well-Known Text (WKT) Representations defined by *OGC*

* Example WKB:
	* POINT (10 10)
	* LINESTRING (10 10,20 20,30 40)
	* POLYGON ((10 10, 10 20, 20 20, 20 15, 10 10))
	* MULTIPOINT ((0 0),(1 2))
	* MULTILINESTRING ((0 0,1 1,1 2),(2 3,3 2,5 4))


## PostGIS provides 

* Processing and analytic functions for both vector and raster data (e.g. splicing, dicing, morphing, reclassifying, and unioning)

* Raster map algebra

* Functions for spatial reprojection 

* Support for ESRI shapefile vector data (+ more formats via 3rd-party tools)

* Importing data from many standard formats
	* Raster data (GeoTiff, NetCDF, PNG, JPG, ...)
	* Vector data (KML,GML, GeoJSON, GeoHash and WKT) 

## PostGIS provides (cont.)
	
* Rendering raster data in various standard formats GeoTIFF, PNG, JPG, NetCDF, ...

* Seamless raster/vector functions for extrusion of pixel values by geometric region, running stats by region, clipping rasters by a geometry, and vectorizing rasters

* 3D object support, spatial index, and functions

* Network topology 

## PostGIS as a GIS

* **PostGIS offers *full* GIS functionality ...**
	* reprojection
	* area calculations 
	* intersect, union, merge ... 

* **... among all data-types**
	* all vector types supported (point, line, area ...)
	* raster layers supported as well

* **and standard interfaces for visualization**
	* QGIS, GRASS spatial layers from a Postgres DB out of the box
	* ArcMap is supposed to do so as well

## PostGIS Functions

* '`ST_`' prefix (Convention for spatial type)
* Functions to work with the *geom* column

* Getting the CRS of the table/layer
```sql
SELECT ST_SRID(geom)
FROM catchments;
```

* Re-project geometry into a different CRS 
```sql
UPDATE subbasins 
SET geom = ST_TRANSFORM(geom, 4326);
```

## PostGIS - Example

* Select cities with certain area and population
```sql
SELECT name, pop FROM cities 
WHERE pop < 300000  
AND ST_Area(cities.the_geom) < 400000000;
```

#
## Data modelling

is **fundamental** for efficient 

* storage of data
* data maintenance
* work with data

## Database normalisation

Normalisation is the formalisation of the design process of making a database compliant with the concept of a Normal Form. 

It addresses various ways in which we may look for repeating data values in a table.

There are several levels of the Normal Form, and each level requires that the previous level be satisfied.

The normalization process is based on collecting an exhaustive list of all data items to be maintained in the database and 
starting the design with a few "superset" tables. 

## Normalisation- First Normal Form

For best results, start with a reasonable breakdown of all attributes in different tables

Reduce entities to first normal form (1NF) by removing repeating or multivalued attributes to another, child entity.

Basically, make sure that the data is represented as a (proper) table. 

While key to the relational principles, this is somewhat a motherhood statement. 

## Normalisation- First Normal Form

However, there are six properties of a relational table (the formal name for "table" is "relation"):

1. Entries in columns are single-valued.
2. Entries in columns are of the same kind.
3. Each row is unique.
4. Sequence of columns is insignificant.
5. Sequence of rows is insignificant.
6. Each column has a unique name.

\

The most common sins against the first normal form (1NF) are the lack of a Primary Key and the use of "repeating columns." 

## Normalisation- Second Normal Form

Reduce first normal form entities to second normal form (2NF) by removing attributes that are not dependent on the whole primary key.

The purpose here is to make sure that each column is defined in the correct table. Using the more formal names may make this a little clearer. Make sure each attribute is kept with the entity that it describes. 

## Normalisation- Third Normal Form

Reduce second normal form entities to third normal form (3NF) by removing attributes that depend on other, non-key attributes (other than alternative keys).

This basically means that we shouldn't store any data that can either be derived from other columns or belong in another table

## Hands-On 

Start Virtual Machine

Create Database

Create 3D City Database

Import City Model

Inspect Database with pgAdmin

Export building data with QGIS

#
## Start Virtual Machine

* Open VirtualBox

* Import virtual machine:

    * 'File' > 'Import appliance'
    * Select downloaded .ova file
    * Click 'Next', then 'Import'

* Start virtual machine

    * User: ghg
    * Password: potsdam2015

#
## Create Database
Remember:

* We use PostgreSQL as database management system

* Open source

* SQL based

* Use it by console, GUI (pgAdmin), or programming interfaces (R, Python, Java, ...)

* PostGIS adds spatial functionalities

# 
## Create Database

Execute following statement as PostgreSQL admin:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE ghg_handson
WITH OWNER = ghg;
```
... and to enable PostGIS:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
```
It is already done on the VM! \\o/

#
## Create 3D City Database (3DCityDB)

The 3DCityDB is a relational database schema

Schema results from a mapping of the object-oriented data model of CityGML to the relational data model of the RDBMS

Schema is like a 'blueprint' of the database

To create 3DCity DB:
 
Start 'Terminal Emulator'

```bash
cd /home/ghg/Documents/3DCityDB-3.0.0-postgis/PostgreSQL/SQLScripts/
psql ghg_handson -f CREATE_DB.sql
```

## 

Setup requires user input:

1. Spatial Reference Identifier for geometry objects (SRID):

**25833**

2. GML conformant URN encoding for gml:srsName attributes:

**urn:ogc:def:crs,crs:EPSG::25833,crs:EPSG::5783**

#
## Import City Model

## Start 3D City Database Importer/Exporter 

![](./pictures/impexp.png)

## Connect to Database

![](./pictures/impexp_database.png)

## Do the import

![](./pictures/impexp_import.png)

#
## Play around with pgAdmin

pgAdmin provides an interface/gui to:

1. Administration of the DB 
    * Server administration and configuration (pg_hba.conf, postgresql.conf)
    * user and group management
    * setup privileges (permissions what user can do and can **not** do
2. Query the DB
    * Graphical query builder 
    * *sql* window 


## Query the DB

**Ask for all building greater than height X**

Open the *sql*-query window

![](./pictures/pgadmin_query_sql_window.png)

## Graphical query builder 

* Similar to DB connectors shipped with common Office suites
(e.g. MS *the evil*  Office and  Libre*the brave* Office)

* allows drag and drop of required tables
* click selection of required columns
* interface to restrict table attributes

## Graphical query builder 

![](./pictures/graphic_query.png)


## Sql editor window

* is updated based on the graphical query builder
* can send parts of sql query (sub-queries)

![](./pictures/pgadmin_query.png)
